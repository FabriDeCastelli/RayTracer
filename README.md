# RayTracer

Implemented a C++ raytracer with some simple features: texture mapping, shadows, reflection, refraction.
Used *glm* library to handle vector operations. Color computation has been done with reference to the Phong Model.
All objects in the rendered scene are simple geometric figures as Spheres, Planes, Cylinders.
